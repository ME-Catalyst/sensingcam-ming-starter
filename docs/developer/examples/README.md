# Developer Examples

Use this directory to store reusable automation snippets and configuration bundles.

- `sample_configs/` – Drop-in YAML or JSON templates (e.g., Frigate detectors, Node-RED subflows).
- `demo_scripts/` – Helper scripts that demonstrate integrations or API usage.

Refer back to the [`examples/`](../../examples/) folder at the repository root for canonical sample configurations used in testing.
